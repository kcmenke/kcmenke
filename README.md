I am a retired engineer and volunteering at a Raptor Hospital. They do all of their Cbc analysis manually and I was hoping to automate it. I noticed there are many papers on using Yolo, Tensorflow, .... for Red, White and platelets on humans and was wondering if anyone
was working on the same using Raptors. Please contact me if you are interested in helping or already had a solution.
Regards,
